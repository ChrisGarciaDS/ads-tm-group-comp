# ADS 509 Module 3: Group Comparison 

The task of comparing two groups of text is fundamental to textual analysis. There are innumerable applications: survey respondents from different segments of customers, speeches by different political parties, words used in Tweets by different constituencies, etc. In this assignment you will build code to effect comparisons between groups of text data, using the ideas learned in reading and lecture.

This assignment asks you to analyze the lyrics and Twitter descriptions for the two artists you selected in Module 1. If the results from that pull were not to your liking, you are welcome to use the zipped data from the “Assignment Materials” section. Specifically, you are asked to do the following: 

* Read in the data, normalize the text, and tokenize it. When you tokenize your Twitter descriptions, keep hashtags and emojis in your token set. 
* Calculate descriptive statistics on the two sets of lyrics and compare the results. 
* For each of the four corpora, find the words that are unique to that corpus. 
* Build word clouds for all four corpora. 

Each one of the analyses has a section dedicated to it below. Before beginning the analysis there is a section for you to read in the data and do your cleaning (tokenization and normalization).
